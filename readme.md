# Welcome to the dotfiles installation script for Linux by tanhongit.

This script will install dotfiles to your system. It also will install some useful tools, packages, and programs.

After installing Ubuntu, you can run this script to install dotfiles. I added some programs, packages, and tools to this
script. All of them need to be installed for Ubuntu.

It's a simple script, so you can run it easily.
